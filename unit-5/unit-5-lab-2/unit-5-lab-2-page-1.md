# Why Use Models and Simulations?

**In this lab,**you will explore how models and simulations can be used to gain insight into real world phenomena.

**On this page,**you will learn why models and simulations are used instead of real world experiments.

Models and simulations are computer representations of complex phenomena in the real world. They are used to explain or predict real life occurrences. There are many reasons to use computer simulations rather than real world experiments:

* Experimenting in the real world may be **expensive**. For example, a new design for an airplane might fall apart in strong winds. Using a computer to model the shape of the airplane and to simulate the wind behavior can eliminate some bad designs before building a real airplane.
* Experimenting in the real world may be **time-consuming**, such as testing the effects of a genetic mutation in a species across generations.
* Experimenting in the real world may be **dangerous**, such as testing whether a nuclear reactor will survive an earthquake.
* Experimenting in the real world may be **unethical**, such as giving a population a disease to test how fast it spreads.



Computer models rarely capture the full complexity of real situations. For example, models that scientists use to predict the impact of global climate change have to account for hundreds of interconnected factors such as wind patterns, the course of rivers, geological fault lines that cause earthquakes, and interactions of local plants and animals. It would be impossible to include all real interdependent factors in a model. So, researchers make _simplifying assumptions _in their models.

Researchers may use an _iterative design process_, starting with a very simple model and refining that model based on their past experiences to make it more realistic for the next simulation. Highly detailed models may push the limits of current computer speeds. So, researchers may have to limit the complexity of the model. Complex models and simulations depend on abstractions \(simplifications\) to avoid the many details of real world phenomena.

#### For You To Do

1. As a class, come up with some examples of complex real life phenomena for which it would be impractical, impossible, dangerous, or unethical to conduct real world experiments.
2. Explain how modeling and simulations may help with our understanding of these phenomena. What are some pros and cons of using computers to explore these situations?
