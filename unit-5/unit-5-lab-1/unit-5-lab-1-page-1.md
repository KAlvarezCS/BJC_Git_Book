# Searching a Sorted List

**In this lab**, you will explore various algorithms for searching a list.

**On this page**, you will revise your number guessing game from Unit 2 to make the computer guess your number.

#### For You To Do

1. One simple version of the Unit 2 game is in the project link below; click the picture to open it.

2. Play the game a few times and keep track of how many guesses you made to identify the computer's secret number.

#### Thinking Out Loud

**Alphie:** The best I did was 12 guesses.

**Betsy:** I got it in 4 guesses once. I think that's the best you can do.

**Gamal:** If you were really lucky, you could have gotten it in one guess.

**Betsy:** But I have a strategy that isn't just luck.

**Gamal:** You have a strategy that will always work in 4 guesses?!

**Betsy:** Not always 4, but always a lot less than 12.

#### For You To Do

1. What strategy could be used to reliably guess a number in much fewer than 12 tries? Describe your strategy clearly enough for others to use to play the game.
2. With your partner, build a program that uses your strategy to guess someone's secret number. If your secret number is 21, the program should work something like this:![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/5-algorithms/GuessMyNumber.gif "Animation for Number Guessing game")
