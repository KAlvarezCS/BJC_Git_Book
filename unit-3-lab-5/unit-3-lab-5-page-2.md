# Analyzing Global Health Data

**On this page**, you will explore, analyze, and summarize big data about global health trends using an interactive data visualization tool.

**Big data **is a common term that describes extremely large data sets used to discover patterns in human behavior, interactions, and health as well as in environmental science and many other fields. Large data sets can be overwhelming to analyze, but computer software tools can help researchers extract information, identify trends, make connections, and solve problems with big data.

#### For You To Do

1. **Explore **the following interactive data set.

   1. What does each point represent?
   2. What does each axis represent?
   3. What do the colors represent?
   4. What does the size of each point indicate?
   5. What does the slider at the bottom do?
   6. If the interactive graph doesn't work on this page, you can [view it on google.com](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&ctype=b&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=s&met_x=sp_dyn_le00_in&scale_x=lin&ind_x=false&met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&met_s=sp_pop_totl&scale_s=lin&ind_s=false&dimp_c=country:region&ifdim=country&tunit=Y&pit=1437710400000&ind=false&icfg&iconSize=0.5).

2. **Analyze **the data. In the interactive graph above, click the play button in the lower-left or move the slider at the bottom. Discuss the following:

   1. What does this interactive data set tell you about global trends in life expectancy over time \(on average\)?

   2. What about global trends in fertility over time \(on average\)?

   3. Move the slider to 1960 \(all the way to the left\). Describe the meaning of the cluster of orange data points in the lower right. What does this tell you about trends in about this region of the world at that time?

   4. Move the slider to 2015 \(all the way to the right\). Describe the meaning of the cluster of pink data points in the upper left. What does this tell you about trends in about this region of the world at that time?

   5. Move the slider back and forth across time, and select one country that follows a path that is interesting to you. Describe what this tells you about the life expectancy and fertility of this country over this time period.

#### If There Is Time...

1. Use the Internet to research the country you chose. Determine what likely impacted life expectancy and fertility across this time period. Be specific. Was there a war at a time that life expectancy dropped? Were there advances in maternal care at a time that fertility increased?

#### For You To Do

1. **Summarize your findings.** Write a paragraph or two with your partner describing your findings about life expectancy and fertility for this country over this time period.
