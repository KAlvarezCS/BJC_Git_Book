# Metadata

**On this page**, you will learn about and practice answering questions about _metadata_.  
Data can even include _data about itself_. For example, a music file might contain data describing the song title, artist, album, genre, record label, etc. Or an image file might include data for the date that the picture was taken, the location where it was taken, information about the camera settings, etc. This kind of information about data is called **metadata**. Metadata can be useful when working with data because it tells you additional information about the data you are working with.



Because metadata is often not displayed by software, it's easy to violate privacy without realizing it when posting data online. Click the links below to see short excerpts from _Blown to Bits _about:

* [photo metadata identifying your specific camera.](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/5-big-data/4-metadata.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment#hint-1)

* [Word document metadata with deleted text.](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/3-lists/5-big-data/4-metadata.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F3-lists.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment#hint-2)

Here's a BJC video about metadata from University of California, Berkeley. https://youtu.be/dZULyIcxPBg

#### For You To Do

1. #### Work through the following questions about metadata.

   1. A new mobile phone company—unbeknownst to its customers—periodically records random snippets of their conversations and considers the recordings as data. In addition, it collects the following metadata on the conversations:

      * The start and end time of the conversation

      * The phone numbers of the users in the conversation

      * The GPS locations of the users in the conversation

   2. For which of the following goals would it be more useful to analyze the **data** instead of the **metadata**?

      1. To determine the time of day the app is used most frequently in a certain geographic location.

      2. To determine if any of its users was present at the time and place of a crime.

      3. To determine the language most commonly used in user conversations.

      4. To determine the most active users of the app for a given year.

   3. Which of the following is _**not **_an example of _metadata_?

      1. Data about a digital image describing the size of the image, image resolution, color depht, and when the image was created.

      2. Data about a text document containing information about the length of the document, its author, the date the document was written, and a short summary of the content.

      3. Data within a web page containing a description of page content and a list of key words linked to the content.

      4. Data about a pack of wolves describing their habitat, hunting habits, diet and sleep cycles.
