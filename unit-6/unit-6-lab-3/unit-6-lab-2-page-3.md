### Impacts on Communication and Thinking

#### For You To Do

1. Global Impact: Communication, Interaction and Cognition Part 1 \(Duration 8:11 mins\)
   1. [https://youtu.be/a8T3o6ueX\_c](https://youtu.be/a8T3o6ueX_c)
   2. Modern computing gives us new ways to communicate and collaborate \(e-mail, chat, video conferencing, social media, cloud computing\). Widespread access to information in a society helps people identify problems, develop solutions and share results quickly. The video also mentions the Netflix Prize, awarded for developing the best algorithm to recommend movies to customers based on their movie rating history.
2. Global Impact: Communication, Interaction and Cognition Part 2 \(Duration 10:57 mins\)

   2. Human capabilities are enhanced by digitally enabled collaboration and by GPS, sensor networks, smart grids/buildings/transportation and assistive technologies for the disabled. Computing has transformed e-commerce, health care, entertainment and online learning.
3. ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png) Discuss what you learned from these videos.
   Write a paragraph describing how computing innovations have changed human communication, interaction, thought, and learning.

### Large-Scale Collaboration

#### For You To Do

1. Global Impact: Citizen Participation Part 1 \(Duration 2:17 mins\) 
   1. [https://youtu.be/NHNSaIljxLg](https://youtu.be/NHNSaIljxLg)
   2. New technology enables ordinary citizens to help solve important scientific problems. The SETI@home project is one example, in which participant citizens use time on their home computers in the search for intelligent extra-terrestrial signals from outer space.
2. Global Impact: Citizen Participation Part 2 \(Duration 8:53 mins\)
   1. [      https://youtu.be/DOfQuJbrp58](https://youtu.be/DOfQuJbrp58)
   2. This video starts with the fascinating story of the Mechanical Turk \(1770\), a “robot chess player” that supposedly beat Napoleon in a game of chess. That famous hoax is the source for the name of Amazon’s current 'Mechanical Turk' project, which similarly employs humans—many of them—for tasks that are still too difficult for computers, such as image labeling. Aaron Koblin’s '10,000 Sheep' art project is an example of how crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration.
3. ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png) Write a paragraph describing how people use technology to solve problems collaboratively. Include one example of a large scale effort and one example of something you have done.

### Impacts Beyond Computing

#### For You To Do

1. Global Impact: Computing Enables Innovation \(Duration 8:16 mins\)
   1. [https://youtu.be/-RXMkqBZ5Pg](https://youtu.be/-RXMkqBZ5Pg)
   2. Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business and science. IBM’s AI project “Watson” became famous for beating the Jeopardy champions in 2011, but its capabilities are being put to a more serious purpose as a medical consultant to assist doctors and nurses. Computer modeling and simulation makes experimentation and theory testing safer, faster, and cheaper and is used in many areas including climate research. Moore’s Law—the expected doubling of computer power every two years—has allowed industries to plan for future research and development. Advances in computing have increased creativity in other fields as well, including transforming industries entirely as the animation studio Pixar did.
2. ![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png "Talk with Your Partner") Write a paragraph describing three examples of how computing has influenced innovations in other fields.

### Connection to the Real-World

#### For You To Do

1. Global Impact: Economic, Social, Cultural Contexts \(Duration 7:45 mins\)
   1. [https://youtu.be/ymnJRhJzGsw](https://youtu.be/ymnJRhJzGsw)
   2. Computing innovations influence and are influenced by the economic, social and cultural contexts in which they are designed and used. Unequal distribution of computing resources raises issues of equity, access and power—the global digital divide. There are efforts both by government and by private corporations—for example, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s internet.org project—that aim to bring the Internet and provide infrastructure to parts of the world currently without access.
2. ![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png "Talk with Your Partner")Write a paragraph describing two connections between computing and the real-world. Your examples can be social, economic, or cultural.

### Benefits and Harms

#### For You To Do

1. Global Impact: Intellectual Property \(Duration 12:03 mins\)
   1. [https://youtu.be/hnXJd8ePD1c](https://youtu.be/hnXJd8ePD1c)
   2. Widespread access to digitized information raises legal and ethical questions about ownership and control of intellectual property—the creative work of others. Copyright protects creators, but also limits others’ access to the materials. How long should copyright—for example, the Mickey Mouse copyright—last and how should that affect who may see copyright protected materials? This video discusses the Digital Millennium Copyright Act \(DMCA\), Creative Commons licensing and other topics.
2. ![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png "Talk with Your Partner")Intellectual property is one of the complex issues of computing. Identify some other issues with pros and cons, and write two paragraphs: one describing two benefits of computing and one describing two harmful impacts of computing.
