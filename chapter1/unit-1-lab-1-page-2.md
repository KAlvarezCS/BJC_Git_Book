## Programming Your App

**On this page, **you will choose a costume for a sprite, how to modify a costume, and how to have the sprite change costume when it is clicked.

## For You To DO![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/work-with-a-partner.png "Work with a Partner")

1. Make sure you have Snap_!_open \([**http://snap.berkeley.edu/run**](http://snap.berkeley.edu/run)\) and that you are logged in.
2. Create two "Alonzo" costumes for your sprite. The video below shows how, and below the video are detailed instructions.
   These instructions explain the video:
   1. Select "Costumes..." from the File \(![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png "File button")\) menu, choose "Alonzo," and click "Import" and then "Cancel."
 
      ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/choosing-Alonzo.png "choosing the Alonzo costume")
   2. Right-click \(on a Mac, control-click\) the Alonzo costume
      _in the center Costumes area_
      \(as shown in the video above\) and select "duplicate."
   3. Right-click \(or control-click\) the new costume called "Alonzo\(2\)", and select "edit."
   4. Click the "flip ‚ü∑" button, and then click "OK."
3. Program the sprite to change costumes when it is clicked...
   1. Click the "Scripts" tab above the center Costumes area.
 
      ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/snap-center-tabs.png "Scripts tab")
   2. Drag blocks into the center Scripts area to build this script. For more support, read the yellow box below.

      ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/motion-palette-categories.jpg "Palette categories: Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators, and Variables")
      You can find blocks in palettes with their matching color: purple for Looks, yellow for Control, etc.

      Drag one block underneath another to snap them together. The thin white bar shows where the blocks will snap together if you release the mouse button.
4. Un-check the "draggable" box under the sprite name input box. This will keep players from accidentally dragging the sprite when they click it.

5. Check your program: click _on Alonzo _on the white stage. If your script works, Alonzo should face the other way.
