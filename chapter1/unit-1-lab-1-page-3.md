## Saving and Pair Programming

**On this brief page,**you will save your work and swap who's at the keyboard.

### Saving Your Work

It is good practice to save regularly so that you don't lose the work that you've done.

1. If you are not logged in, [log in now](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/1-creating-a-snap-account.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment). Then save this as "U1L1-ClickAlonzo"
   Choose "Save" from the File menu \(![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png "File button")\), and give your project a name that will help you remember what the project is. For this project, use U1L1-ClickAlonzo.
   ```
    Only one partner needs to save now. You'll share the project with both partners at the end of this lab.
   ```

### Pair Programming Swap

Many professional programmers use a technique called [pair programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)â€”writing computer programs in teams of two. One partner controls the computer, and the other helps plan and helps catch errors._**They switch roles often.**_

In this course, you will do that too. Aim for equal time in each role.

#### **Why collaborate? **Collaboration can...

* Reduce the amount of work each person has to do.
* Allow you to divide up a big task and work on the pieces independently.
* Help solve problems because each person brings a different perspective.
* Make it easier to find mistakes in your code.

* If you haven't swapped yet, swap now. \(If you are using two computers, switch seats.\) ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap-mini.png "Pair Programming Swap")
