# Sharing Your App

**On this page, **you will learn how to get a link for sharing your app and how to load your app on a mobile device.

### For You To Do

1. Make sure project is saved.
2. Choose "Open..." from the File menu and **select the file **from the project list \(in this lab, "U1L1-ClickAlonzo"\), and click "Share." \(See the video below.\)

3. You will be asked if you are sure you want to publish. Click "Yes." \(Then click either "Cancel" or "Open" to close that menu. It doesn't matter which.\)

4. Copy the URL \(web address\) from the top of your browser window. You can **use that link **to share the app.

           You can also make a \[tiny URL\]\([http://tinyurl.com/\](http://tinyurl.com/\)\) for your game to make typing the URL easier.

Here's a video that shows how: [https://youtu.be/RJUiqWRuzmA](https://youtu.be/RJUiqWRuzmA)

1. ![](/assets/pair_programming.png)Log out and let your partner log in. Open the link you created with the first partner's account, and save the project in the second partner's account so that you both have a copy.

   ```
     Note: These are copies--not the same file. So, if you change the project in one person's account, 
     it will not change in the other person's account; you will need to save it to their account again.
   ```
