# Greeting the Player

![](/assets/pair_programming.png)

```
Your Click Alonzo script runs _when Alonzo is clicked. _**On this page,**you'll make a second script that welcomes the player _when the green flag \(_![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png "green-flag button")_\) is clicked._
```

![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/hat-block.png "a yellow round-topped hat block that says When") Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an **event **such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button. They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script \(as a way to start the script\), Snap\_!\_programmers call them "hat blocks."

Clicking the green flag \(![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png "green-flag button")\) starts all scripts that begin with the`when green flag is clicked`hat block. You can stop all running scripts by clicking the red stop sign \(![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png "stop button")\) at the top right of the Snap\_!\_window.

## For You To Do

1. If it isn't open already, open your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project.
2. Crete a second script that makes Alonzo move to \(190,-130\) and say a welcome message whenever the green flag is click. \(Alonzo might say, "Welcome to 'Click On Alonzo!' Keep clicking me if you can!"\).
3. Make that message disappear when the player clicks on Alonzo. The ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/blocks/say-empty.png "say \(\)")block with an empty input will make the sprite say nothing.
4. Check that your app does everything what you want:  
   1. When the green flag is click, Alonzo should move to \(190,-130\) and say its message.  
   2. When Alonzo is clicked, the message should disappear, and Alonzo should move to a random spot on the stage and face the other way,.
