#### For You To Do

1. Artificial Intelligence is a very active field with many interesting developments announced daily. Choose a topic you're interested in \(like medicine, finance, politics, education, communication, law, gaming, astronomy, psychology, transportation, literature, international policy, etc.\) and find 2-3 recent news articles that relate to developments in AI in that field. Be prepared to share what you find with the class.

   * In addition to reporting new developments, mention challenges for AI that still remain.

   * Try to find stories about current developments and that focus on AI more generallyâ€”not just robots.
