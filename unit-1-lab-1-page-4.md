## Moving Randomly

**On this page, **you'll add code to make Alonzo move to a random position each time he's clicked.

The blocks you'll need can be found in the Motion and Operators palettes.

### For You To Do

1. If you don't already have your U1L1-ClickAlonzo project open, open it now.

   1. Click the file button and select "Open..." to see a list of all your projects.

2. Find ![](/assets/random-1-10.png) in the green Operators palette, and click it several times to see what it does.

3. ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png)Describe clearly what the random block does.

Use the `go to`and`random`blocks together to made Alonzo move around randomly.

1. Snap the ![](/assets/goto_block.png) block onto the end of your script.

2. Snap a ![](/assets/random_block.png) block into each input slot of ![](/assets/goto_block.png). The animation shows how, but you'll need to do more than it shows.

3. Click on Alonzo. If you've left the 1 and 10 in the input slots of the ![](/assets/random_block.png) Alonzo will move only tiny distances.

4. Change the inputs to ![](/assets/random_block.png) so Alonzo moves to random coordinates, with x varying from -190 and 190, and y varying from -130 through 130.

5. Click Alonzo. If your script work, Alonzo should face the other way and move to a random spot.

   Locations on the stage \(the white rectangle where sprites perform their scripts\) are specified by **coordinates**. The center   of the stage is \(0, 0\). The left edge is _x_= -240; the right edge is _x_= 240. The bottom and top are _y_= -180 and _y_= 180.

6. Discuss why it makes sense to limit Alonzo's movements to less than the full range of the stage \(for example, by limiting his horizontal movements to between -190 to 190 instead of the full -240 to 240\).
