# Network Redundancy

Given the enormous amount of data traveling around, the Internet needs to be reliable. We have achieved this by building many **redundant **connections into the physical systems of the Internet. Wherever information is going, there is more than one way to get there, so that if part of the Internet fails, the rest remains connected even if the failed part is in the usual path from one place to another. This increases the Internet's **fault tolerance**\(ability to work around problems\). And it also helps the Internet **scale**\(expand\) to more devices and people.

Internet **scalability **is the ability of the net to keep working even as the size of the network and the amount of traffic over the network increase. The page [Internet 2012 in numbers](http://royal.pingdom.com/2013/01/16/internet-2012-in-numbers/) has some astonishing numbers about Internet traffic from a few years ago.

#### For You To Do

1. ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png)Describe what's going on in this animation. ![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundancy.gif "redundancy in action")
2. Walk through the following two questions below.
   1. In this model of a network, what is the _minimum _number of nodes \(connection points\) that can stop working before the sender and the receiver can't communicate? \(Other than the sender or the receiver themselves, of course.\)![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/4-internet/redundant-2.jpg "network redundancy")
