# What Is the Internet?

The **Internet **is a network of independent but connected devices all over the world. People talk as if "the Internet" and "the World Wide Web" are the same thing, but they are not. The **World Wide Web **is the collection of interlinked website _documents_\(such as [HTML](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/6-computers/optional-projects/writing-html.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment) files\) that you can view with a web browser by typing addresses like [http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html](http://bjc.berkeley.edu/website/privacy.html).

Most web pages are written with HTML \(hypertext markup language\) and interpreted by your browser using HTTP \(hypertext transfer protocol\).

#### What is a URL?

A **URL**, or **Uniform Resource Locator**, is an address for accessing specific web data located on a **server **\(a computer hosting data for others to access\). URLs can be broken into three parts:

![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/4-internet/URL-structure.jpg "parts of a URL")

* **protocol** - the standard for communication between browsers and servers \(usually "http" or "https"\)
* **domain name** - the name of the server that hosts data
* **path** - the location of the data in the hierarchy of folders on the server

For example, the URL shown above tells a browser to use the http protocol to access the bjc.berkeley.edu server and then go to the website folder and open the privacy.html file.

#### For You To Do

1. ![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png "Talk with Your Partner")

But the Internet is more general than the World Wide Web. It also supports email, file transfers, mobile apps, texting \(a.k.a. SMS or Short Message Service\), and many other ways that computers communicate behind the scenes.

The **Internet **is a massive network of computers that communicate, facilitating communication around the globe. They do this primarily by using a pair of **protocols**\(standards for communication\) that you will learn more about in another lab:

* [**IP**](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment) \(Internet Protocol\), an addressing system that finds paths to distant computers

* [**TCP**](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/2-tcp.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment) \(Transmission Control Protocol\), a reliable transmission system that sends and tracks binary sequences of data \(ones and zeros\) that are split into small packets sent separately

The algorithms that ensure data reach their destinations must continue to work even as the Internet grows. So, the Internet was designed to be:

* [**Redundant**](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/2-network-redundancy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment): There are multiple pathways among the physical connections of the Internet to create redundancy. Even if one pathway is unavailable, there is still another way to transmit a message from sender to receiver \(as shown\).

* [**Hierarchical**](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/1-reliable-communication/3-address-hierarchy.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment): There are two hierarchical Internet addressing systems, domain names \(as shown below\) and [IP addresses](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/4-internet/2-communication-protocols/1-ip.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F4-internet.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment). These address hierarchies works much like the postal system, which locates people first by state, then city, then street, then house number, then apartment, and then finally person.

The next two pages of this lab are about these two ideas.
