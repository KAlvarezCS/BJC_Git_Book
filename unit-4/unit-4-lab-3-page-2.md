# Symmetric Cryptography

You might have used a**substitution cipher**to encode your message, substituting each letter of the alphabet with some other letter. You could substitute letters in any order, like this:

          ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

          PQVFUBZOTHWYELIXRNAMGDSCKJ

That's called a **general substitution cipher**.

Or you might just _shift _the letters in order. For example, this is a shift of 3:

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

That's called a **Caesar Cipher**\(named for Julius Caesar\) or a **shift cipher**.

Substitution ciphers are examples of symmetric encryption because they use the same key for both encryption and decryption.

#### For You To Do ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png)

1. The person who receives your message has to know how to decode it. Describe a method for decoding a message that is created with a Caesar cipher.
2. How would you decode a message created with a general substitution cipher? What are some ways you could make the encryption more secure?

#### Take It Further

1. Even a general substitution cipher is relatively easy to break because some letters are used more frequently than others.

   1. Read about Al-Kindi, the Arabic philosopher and mathematician who first described the frequency analysis method of code-breaking, in "Breaking Substitution Ciphers" \(Blown to Bits pages 166-169\)
   2. This method is still useful today, even with better cryptography tools: How as 1200-year-old Hacking Technique Can Already Crack Tomorrow's Encrypted Vaults \(Forbes, 9/3/15\)

2. Read "Secret Keys and One-Time Pads" \([_Blown to Bits_pages 169-173](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=187)\) to learn about Vigen√®re ciphers and methods used during World War 2 and the Cold War.
