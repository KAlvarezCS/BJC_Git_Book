# Communication and Community

#### For You To Do

1. What are some different ways we use technology to communicate? Generate a list as a class.
2. Choose one means of communication \(such as cell phone call, SMS, Facebook, Skype, Twitter, etc.\) and use the Internet to figure out what you can about how that technology works. Remember to cite your sources.

Check out [Teaching Privacy](http://www.teachingprivacy.org/), a site about protecting yourself from giving away your location through social media.

#### Take It Further

1. Make a short video explaining what you learned about how one of these ways of communicating works.



#### For You To Do

1. Four Corners \(class activity\). Do you "strongly agree," "agree," "disagree," or "strongly disagree" with the following statements?

   1. Computers are isolating. \(That is, they cause us to spend less time with other people.\)
   2. Computers are democratizing. \(That is, they give more political power to ordinary people.\)



You will choose a viewpoint, then present your reasons for taking that view.
