# Cyberbullying

#### For You To Do

1. What are some different forms cyberbullying can take?

   1. Conduct some online research. Use these resources, or find your own:

      1. [How to defeat Internet bullies \(CS Monitor\)](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2015/0327/How-to-defeat-Internet-bullies)
      2. [Cyber Bullying \(Violence Prevention Works\)](http://www.violencepreventionworks.org/public/cyber_bullying.page)
      3. [What methods work with the different kinds of cyberbullies? \(stopcyberbullying.org\)](http://stopcyberbullying.org/educators/howdoyouhandleacyberbully.html)
      4. [Six Unforgettable CyberBullying Cases \(NoBullying.com\)](http://nobullying.com/six-unforgettable-cyber-bullying-cases/)

2. Have a class discussion. First, share some of your findings from the online research about the different forms cyberbullying can take. Then, together, discuss the following:

   * What are some ways to effectively address this issue?

   * What are challenges to addressing cyberbullying?

#### Take It Further

1. How can you bring some of these ideas to the rest of the school? What should all students at your school know about cyberbullying? What school-wide policies might you suggest and communicate to the rest of the student body?
