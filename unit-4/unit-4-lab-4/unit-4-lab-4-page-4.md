## Does it matter where you search?

#### For You To Do

1. Open the search engine you usually use, the [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)
   search engine, and another search engine such as [Google](http://google.com/), [Yahoo](http://yahoo.com/), or [Bing](http://bing.com/). Search for a phrase, like "Internet search engines" or "New York restaurants." Do you get the same search results at each site? Try a search related to politics, such as "Barack Obama."

2. Read [ dontbubble.us](/dontbubble.us).

3. Discuss with a partner, then share with the class. How do you think a search engine works? What algorithm might the search engine use to decide what to show you?

4. In [_Blown to Bits_](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter4.pdf), the authors claim that "search is a new form of control over information" \(p. 111\) and "search is power" \(p. 145\). Why might it be important to think of the social implications behind searching on the Internet?

#### Take It Further

1. Google keeps track of searches. You can check out [the day's trending topics](http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends) or [the top searches of 2014 \(or any year back to 2004\) in the United States \(or globally\)](http://www.google.com/trends/topcharts?hl=en#vm=cat&geo=US&date=2014&cid).
