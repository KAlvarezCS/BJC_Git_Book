# Creating Bar Graphs

**In this project, **you will create a _general purpose _data visualization tool that can generate bar graphs for a variety of data sets. You will practice using _abstraction _and the higher order function `map`.

#### For You To Do 

1. Technology has come at the cost of environmental pollution around the world. In collaboration with your partner, examine the data table given on [this link](http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html#.WVqJI9PytE5).

   1. What countries have the highest Carbon Dioxide \(CO2\) emissions?
   2. What countries have the highest CO2 emissions per capita \(per person\)?

   3. Which of these measures do you think is a better indicator a country's contribution to global environmental pollution?

   4. You can gain knowledge and insights by talking to others \(in person or online\) as you form questions and hypotheses about data.

   1. A _constructor _of a new ADT \(Abstract Data Type\) called `data-record `with two fields `label `and `value`.![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/3-lists/BarGraph_img/datalabelvaluewithResult.png "data-record ADT")

   2. Two _selectors _for the new ADT, to extract specific data from a `data-record `input.
