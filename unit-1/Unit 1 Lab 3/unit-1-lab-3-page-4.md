# Modify Your Pinwheel

**On this page,** you will modify your existing pinwheel block so that you can use it to draw a variety of shapes.

### Adding Multiple Inputs

Recall how you first generalized your original pinwheel script: you added an input variable called branches that controlled the turning angle of the sprite. By adding more input variables, you can generalize other aspects of your program...

1. If it isn't already open, open your U1L3-Pinwheel project.

2. Experiment with the input for the _second _`move`block inside your `pinwheel`block as shown below.

   1. ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png) First predict. What do you think will happen?

3. Add a second input variable to control the amount of "backing up" that the sprite does before each turn through the full 360Â°.

4. Change the `pinwheel`script so that it will accept a positive value \(between 0 and 100\) for backup.
