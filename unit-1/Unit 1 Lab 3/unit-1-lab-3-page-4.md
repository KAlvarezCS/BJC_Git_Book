**On this page,** you will modify your existing pinwheel block so that you can use it to draw a variety of shapes.

### Adding Multiple Inputs

Recall how you first _generalized _your original pinwheel script: you added an input variable called branches that controlled the turning angle of the sprite. By adding _more _input variables, you can generalize other aspects of your program...

1. If it isn't already open, open your U1L3-Pinwheel project.

2. Experiment with the input for the _second _`move `block inside your `pinwheel `block as shown below.

   1. ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png) First predict. What do you think will happen?

1. Add a _second input variable _to control the amount of "backing up" that the sprite does before each turn through the full 360Â°.

2. Change the `pinwheel `script so that it will accept a _positive _value \(between 0 and 100\) for backup.
