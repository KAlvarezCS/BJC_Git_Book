# Looping with a Counter

You've seen these ways to repeat a set of commands:

* ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/blocks/forever.png "the forever block") repeats the same commands _forever_. \(You used it to [make Alonzo keep moving](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/1-building-an-app/6-keeping-score.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment).\)

* ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat.png "the repeat block")repeats them _a specific number of times. _\(You used it to [draw shapes](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/3-drawing/1-exploring-motion.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment).\)

**Vocabulary**

Computer scientists describe this program structure as looping, repetition, or **iteration**. [Sequencing, selection](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/1-introduction/2-gossip-and-greet/4-learning-names.html?topic=nyc_bjc%2F1-intro-loops.topic&course=bjc4nyc.html&novideo&noassignment#AP), and iteration are building blocks of algorithms.

The `forever `block generates an _infinite loop _that goes on forever. An infinite loop can sometimes be the result of a bug, but in some interactive programs, you _want _the program to keep running until stopped by the user.
