# Exploring Motion

These are works by artists Josef Albers, Maya Hayuk, Vassily Kandinsky, Atta Kwami, Kazimir Malevich, Carlos Merida, Piet Mondrian, Alma Thomas, and Theo van Doesburg. The styles are different, but all of them are based on polygons or circles.

**In this lab, **you'll draw polygons so you can create your own art:  
![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/polygon-row.png "regular polygons")  
![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/GraphicArt_img/ColoredSquareMesh.png "random colored squares on black background")**On this page, **you will explore the basics of drawing a shape in Snap_! _by using the `repeat `block to loop through the same code multiple times.

**Vocabulary: Algorithm**

An **algorithm **is a sequence of steps that are usually performed by a computer. In some programming languages, like Snap_!_, you program algorithms by dragging blocks \(individual instructions\) and snapping them together. In other languages, you _type _the instructions. The idea is the same.

An algorithm _isn't _a computer program \(it isn't the code\) but rather a _general description of the steps _the computer should follow. The algorithm isn't specific to a particular programming language; once you know the steps that the computer will take \(that is, once you have your algorithm\), you can write the code in the language of your choice.

### For You To Do

1. ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/work-with-a-partner.png "Work with a Partner")![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner.png "Talk with Your Partner")Imagine what this algorithm will make the sprite do: ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat-4%28move-50-wait-turn-right-90-wait%29.png "repeat \(4\) \(move \(50\), wait \(0.5\) secs, turn clockwise \(90\), wait \(0.5\) secs\)")

2. Log in to [Snap_!_](http://snap.berkeley.edu/run) and build that script to test your hypothesis.

   Clicking on a script runs it.

   1. Click it, and watch what the sprite does.
   2. Click
      ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pen-down.png "pen down"), and then click your script to run it again.

3. ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/talk-with-your-partner-mini.png "Talk with Your Partner")Analyze _why _that script does what it does.

4. Compare your work with another pair. If your script behaves differently from theirs, check both.

![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/icons/pair-programming-swap.png "Pair Programming Swap") Switch who is sitting at the keyboard.

1. Now experiment.

   1. Change 100 to 50 as shown ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-50.png "move 50 steps") in the `move `block _of your script_, and click the script again to run it with the new input value.

   2. Click the ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear.png "clear") block in the green Pen palette. You can click ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/blocks/clear.png "clear")\(or any block\) in the palette or in the scripting area to run it. If you click a block inside a script, the whole script runs.

   3. Change the number in the ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-right-90.png "turn right 90 degrees") block and run the script again... and again... and again.

   4. Change the number in the ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/repeat-4.png "repeat 4") block.

   5. Experiment with the input numbers in the `turn `and `repeat `blocks. Try to draw a triangle.

   6. Use![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-pen-size-to-blank.png "set pen size to \(\)") to set the pen size to something like 4 or 10 or 50. Then draw something.

         To change the pen size you must _click _the `set pen size `block to run it after you've entered the number you want.

**If There Is Time...**

1. Experiment: What leaves a trace?

   1. Move the sprite by dragging it to a new location. Does it leave a trace as you move it?

      1. Move the sprite by clicking on![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/move-50.png "move 50 steps").  Does it leave a trace as it moves?
      2. Click ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png "go to x 0 y 0"). Does it leave a trace?

The ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/blocks/go-to-x-y-0-0.png "go to x 0 y 0") block can get your sprite back when it runs off the screen.
