# Graphics and Art

**On this page,**You will create and use blocks that let you draw polygons, circles and stars to explore art and graphic design.

##### For You To Do

1. If you have not done so already, build a block to draw a regular polygon of a given number of sides and a given side length. ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/GraphicArt_img/polygonCode.png)

2. You may also wish to build a custom block to draw a rectangle of given length and width. ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/GraphicArt_img/rectangleCode.png)

3. In the scripting area, set out a collection of the tools and blocks that may be handy in creating your art work. You can adjust the input values for these blocks as needed as you create your art. This video shows how to create some overlapping regions and then fill some of them with color. ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L3p7Graphic&Art.gif)

4. Make your own art. Explore a few different combinations of shape and color. Take screen shots of your art work and share them with the class, perhaps on a class webpage if your class has one.

##### If There Is Time...

1. ![](/assets/share.png) with another pair. If you see some feature or code that you like, build something like it in your own program.

#### Take It Further

1. Look up the works of artists like [Josef Albers](https://www.google.com/search?q=Josef+Albers&tbm=isch), [Maya Hayuk](https://www.google.com/search?q=Maya+Hayuk&tbm=isch) , [Vassily Kandinsky](https://www.google.com/search?q=Vassily+Kandinsky&tbm=isch), [Atta Kwami](https://www.google.com/search?q=Atta+Kwami&tbm=isch), [Kazimir Malevich](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kazimir+Malevich&tbm=isch), [Carlos Merida](https://www.google.com/search?q=Carlos+Merida&tbm=isch), [Piet Mondrian](https://www.google.com/search?q=Piet+Mondrian&tbm=isch), [Alma Thomas](https://www.google.com/search?q=Alma+Thomas&tbm=isch) , and [Theo van Doesburg](https://www.google.com/search?q=Theo+van+Doesburg&tbm=isch) to get inspiration to create new art in your own style. ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/Josef_Albers's_painting_'Homage_to_the_Square',_1965.jpg "painting-by-Josef-Albers")![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/GraphicArt_img/MayaHayuk1.jpg "Maya Hayuk")![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/1280px-Vassily_Kandinsky,_1926_-_Several_Circles,_Gugg_0910_25.jpg "painting-by-Kandinsky")![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/GraphicArt_img/AttaKwami_bobbo.jpg "Atta Kwami")

2. Below are some other ideas that use randomness, color and other artistic elements. Create your own art that incorporates randomness in some way. Here is one way you can add randomness to your art:![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/GraphicArt_img/randomArtCode.png "Code for random art")  

3. You can modify your polygon block to create stars that you can use in your art work.![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/GraphicArt_img/starCode.png "Code for a star")This script will only create stars with an odd number points. Why?

4. Use what you already know to draw a flag you like.

   1. Figure out how to change your `star `block so that it can draw either kind. \(You'll have to add another input.\)
      1. Is there a third kind of seven-pointed star? Why or why not? Discuss this with your partner and maybe with another pair.
      2. How many kinds of nine-pointed stars can you make? Draw them all with your
         `star`
         block.
      3. How many kinds of six-pointed stars are there? Draw a six-pointed star by hand, then try it with your
         `star`
         block. Explain the results.
      4. How many kinds of eight-pointed stars can you make?
      5. Work with your partner to come up with a general theory of stars, so you could predict how many kinds of 98-pointed stars you can make without trying them all.
