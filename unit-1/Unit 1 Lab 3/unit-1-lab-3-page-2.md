# Angles and Turning

**On this page, **you will learn about sprite turning angles, which are needed for drawing polygons. For starters, you'll draw various asterisks, like these:

### **For You To Do**

2. Then, experiment with the last script \(shown right\):

   1. Experiment with a _quarter _turn \(90 degrees\):
      1. Change the `turn `block
         _input _by clicking on the 180 and typing 90.
      2. Adjust the number of repetitions \(the number you give to `repeat`\) until you get the sprite to finish facing the same way it started.
   2. Experiment with a _tenth _of a turn \(36 degrees\).
      * What input must you give to `repeat `to get the sprite to finish facing the same way it started?
   3. Try different input values for the `move `-100 `steps `block \(like -50, -10, or -90\), and do some of the turning experiment \(above\) again. Does this change the values needed for the `repeat `block?
   4. Try completely removing the second `move `block \(right-click or control-click and then choose "delete"\). Try some of the turning experiments again.

3. ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png)Describe what you've learned about turning angles.



A 360° turn is a full turn. Half of that \(180°\) is a half turn. A fourth of 360° ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/360-divided-by-4-with-result-90.png "360-divided-by-4-with-result-90") is a quarter turn. You don't have to do the division yourself. Snap_! _can compute it for you. You can use ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees.png "turn-360-divided-by-7-degrees") or ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/turn-360-divided-by-3-degrees.png "width=&quot;219&quot; height=&quot;34&quot; ") to get a seventh of a turn or a third of a turn.

   1. Change the inputs in script A to draw an asterisk with:
      1. 5 branches
      2. 8 branches
      3. 3 branches
   2. Make a copy of the three-branch script you built \(right-click or control-click the script, and choose "duplicate"\).
      1. Then, remove the `move `-100 `steps `block.
      2. What does this new script do?
   3. Make another copy of the three-branch script you built, and then:
      1. Change it to a four-branch script.
      2. Remove the `move `-100 `steps`block again.
      3. What does this new script do?

### If There Is Time...

1.  Script B in the same file shows how you can make a 60-branch script behave like the second hand of a clock. Try it out.
   1. ![](/assets/twoPeopleThinking.png)Be sure you are able to explain _how_ this script does what it does.
   2. Why is the change in pen color and size useful here?
