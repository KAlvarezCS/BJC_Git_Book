# Learning Player Names

**On this page,**you will create a `greet player `script that greets users \(such as "Anthony"\) by either:

* Saying "Nice to meet you, Anthony" and storing Anthony's name in a player list for next time.

or

* Saying "Nice to see you again, Anthony" if Anthony's name is already on the list.

#### For You To Do

##### Vocabulary** **

The decision is made by `if-else`.  
![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player-skeleton.png "greet player skeleton")  
The `if`and `if-else `blocks are called conditionals because they control the code based on a **condition**\(here, whether the list of players contains this player's name\). Deciding \(selecting\) which part of an algorithm to run based on a condition is called **selection**.

**Sequencing **is the process of ordering the code \(putting it in a sequence\), as you do here.

1. [http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html\#open:http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1L2-GreetPlayer.xml](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1L2-GreetPlayer.xml) It contains most of the code you'll need to make the script.
2. Snap the pieces together in a sequence so that:

   The greeter will `ask`the player for their name.  
   1. **If **the player's name is in the player list,

   * `Say`"nice to see you again,_player name_."
     1. **Otherwise **when the player isn't on the list,
   * `Say`"nice to meet you,_player name_," and
   * `Add `the player's name to the player list.

3. Test and debug. Make sure the script works the way you want it to.

4. Create a ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/greet-player.png "player greeter block") command block, and drag in your working script.

5. Click `greet player `several times to test that it works as expected. Fix any bugs.
