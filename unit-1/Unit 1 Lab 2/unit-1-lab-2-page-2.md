# Customizing and Debugging

**On this page, **you will edit the word lists used by the sprites and debug any problems.

### For You To Do

1. Open your U1L2-Gossip project. Edit these three reporter blocks to change the phrases that the program uses. \(See instructions in the box below.\) Be creative and funny, but thoughtful.![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/who.png "who block")![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/does-what.png "does what block")![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/who2.png "who2 block")

#### **How to Edit a Block**

1. **Find the block**
   in the scripting area or the colored palettes on the left.
2. **Control-click**
   \(or right-click\) on the block and choose "edit..."
3. **Make changes**
   to the block's internal code. \(Instructions are already inside these blocks.\)
4. **Click OK**
   when you're satisfied. \(Or click "Cancel" if you don't want to make changes.\)![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L2P2-EditABlock.gif)

### Vocabulary

This process of testing, finding problems, and fixing them is called **debugging**.

2. Make sure your program works. Test each block as well as the program as a whole. If something doesn't work, don't go on without fixing it.![](/assets/save.png)

### If There Is Time...

3. Make the sprites gossip only when you click on them.

4. Change the background on the Stage.![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L2-GossipBackground.gif)5. Change the costumes to anything you like. You can use a photograph or picture from the Internet by dragging the image into the costume area for that sprite.

If the picture you choose is too big, set its size to something less than 100% using![](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/blocks/set-size-empty.png "set size to \(100\)%"). You may also want to adjust the rotation style of your sprite using the buttons near the upper left corner of your scripting area.
