**In this project, **you will learn how to use thick lines \(with round or flat ends\) to design artwork of your own.

#### For You To Do

1. [Click here to load. Save to Your Snap! account.](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/prog/1-introduction/U1-project-modeling-art.xml) The file contains five scripts.
   1. The first script is just for cleanup.
   2. Experiment with the other scripts to see what they can do. Ideas are suggested below.
   3. IDEAS FOR EXPERIMENTS. Use as many as you want.

   4. * SCRIPT 1
        1. Clear the stage, set the pen down, try this script, and describe the result in terms of the code.
        2. Clear the stage, change the 100 steps to 0.5 steps, and describe the result.
        3. Click on the √ mark to turn`flat line ends `off. Then try the first two experiments again.
      * SCRIPT 2
        1. Click to see what `tunnel `does.
        2. Edit `tunnel `to see how it works.
        3. Choose other numbers to try in the various inputs _inside _`tunnel`. Change only one or two at a time, to see what they do.
      * SCRIPT 3
        1. Think about what the `for `loop changes.
        2. Together, what do the `set pen size to (i × 50) `and `move (i × 50) steps `do?
        3. What does the subsequent `move (i × -50) steps `do?
      * SCRIPT 4
        1. Experiment with fewer steps.
        2. See what happens with flat line ends.
        3. Edit to see how the `sphere `block works.
2. Then model some artist or invent designs of your own. Save your designs and choose your favorite\(s\) to share. This code uses a Snap_! _tool you haven't seen before:![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/set-flag-flat-line-ends.png "set-flag-flat-line-ends-to-true"). If you want it for other projects, you can load it from the Snap!
   File menu by selecting "Provide getters and setters..." as shown below.![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/File-menu-import-library.png "File-menu-import-library")
