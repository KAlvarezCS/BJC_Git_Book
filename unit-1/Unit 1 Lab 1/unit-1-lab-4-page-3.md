**On this page, **you will read a story that shows how complex privacy issues can be and learn about the massive expansion of digital information.

#### For You To Do

1. Read [_Blown to Bits_pages 1-4](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=19). As you read, be prepared to discuss the following:

   * According to the authors, **what are some things that have changed as a result of computers?**
   * What do the authors mean by "explosion of bits"?

#### If There Is Time



1. Police couldn't access Tanya Rider's records because of her right to privacy. **Is there a way to make a policy that preserves one's right to privacy and also makes sure a person like Tanya Rider gets rescued? **Write down three arguments for each of the following positions.

   * Position A: The right to privacy isn't just an abstract principle. Sometimes for example, people disappear to hide from people who might hurt them. When a person is reported missing, the police can't assume that's the whole story; they have to follow the rules even if that delays some rescues. Also, maybe that person is trying to avoid the police!
   * Position B: The police should be able to check the location of a phone right away to search for a missing person, perhaps with a rule that they can't use the information for any other purpose, or disclose it to anyone, without permission from a court.

Is there a third policy that protects _everyone's _needs?
