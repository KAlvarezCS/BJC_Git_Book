# Make It a Game

**On this page, **you'll make your app more like a game. Each time the player clicks on Alonzo, he will become a little lighter. The goal of the game is to click on Alonzo until he disappears.![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L1P6_AlonzoFading.gif)

## For You To Do

1. To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this forever." And there is a block that does it:  
   ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png "forever")Modify your Alonzo script so that it keeps going.  
   ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/U1ImageVideoAddendum_img/U1L1P6_toofast.png "when I am \(clicked\), say &apos;&apos;, forever \[next costume, go to x: \(pick random \(-190\) to \(190\)\) y: \(pick random \(-130\) to \(130\)\)\]")

2. Alonzo moves too fast! use the ![](/assets/wait1.png)block to slow him down. You can increase or reduce the wait time if you like.

3. The command ![](/blocks/changeGhost.png)controls Alonzo's brightness. Experiment with different inputs to see exactly what it does.

4. Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little lighter.

5. Play your game a few times. Adjust your code to get a level of difficulty that you like.![](/assets/save.png)

   You can use the ghost effect and the wait time and to make the game easier or harder.

## If There Is Time...

1. Put another block in your program to change ghost effect by -5 any time Alonzo moves without being clicked.
