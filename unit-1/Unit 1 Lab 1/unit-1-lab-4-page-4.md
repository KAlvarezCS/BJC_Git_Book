#### For You To Do ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png)

1. Discuss:
   1. **What are different ways our privacy is affected by computers?**
   2. **Each pick two sections to read:**
      * Smile While We Snap!
      * Knowing Where You Are
      * Knowing Even Where Your Shoes Are
      * Black Boxes Are Not Just for Airplanes Anymore
      * Tracing Paper
      * The Parking Garage Knows More Than You Think
      * All in Your Pocket
      * Connecting the Dots
2. In groups of four, split up the reading in[_Blown to Bits_pages 22-35](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=40). Each person should pick two sections to read from the list at right. \(Make sure someone reads each section\). As you read, use these guiding questions:

   1. **What are the**
      _**innovations**_
      **described in each section?**
   2. **How are these innovations**
      _**beneficial**_
      **?**
   3. **How do they**
      _**threaten privacy**_
      **?**

3. Teach the other members of your group what you learned in the sections you read.
4. Read the box [How Sites Know Who You Are \(_Blown to Bits_page 40\)](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=58).

#### If There Is Time

1. Read the section "Little Brother is Watching" from [_Blown to Bits_pages 42-48](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=60) for examples of ways people can find out very personal information using online resources.

2. What rules should we have about online information? Read the section called [Fair Information Practice Principles \(_Blown to Bits_page 64-68\)](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=82) to learn about efforts to enact privacy laws and standards. Consider: What laws should we have about privacy? What are some challenges to getting these laws?
