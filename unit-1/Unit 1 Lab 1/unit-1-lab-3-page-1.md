# Your Image In The Cloud

**In this lab,**you will learn about your digital privacy.

**On this page,**you will consider what information is available online about you and reflect on your online data sharing habits.

#### For You To Do ![](/assets/talk_with_partner.png)

1. Discuss: **What kind of digital information is out there about you?**

   * With a partner, write down a list of the kinds of information someone might be able to find out about you by searching on the Internet.
   * Which of these things are information that you voluntarily put online?
   * Which of these things would you prefer to keep private?

#### If There Is Time...

1. Check out some of these resources:

   * [Prezi: Oh the places you and your data will go \(from UC Berkeley\)](https://prezi.com/lc8exztol608/oh-the-places-you-and-your-data-will-go/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy)
   * [PowerPoint about passwords and our online presence \(from UC Berkeley\)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xb34Z7-vdKjdfanIK2vMFpVK5KmCCuYwocDXlD5qpn0/edit#slide=id.p)

##### Take It Further

Look for information about yourself using [acxiom.com](http://acxiom.com/) \(click "AboutTheData.com" at the top - requires registration\).

One of the authors of this course did this and [here's what he found](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/brian-acxiom.pdf). The information circled in red is incorrect.
