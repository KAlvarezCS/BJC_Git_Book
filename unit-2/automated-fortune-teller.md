## Automated Fortune Teller

**In this project, **you will build an automated fortune telling program inspired by the _Magic 8 Ball _® that randomly offers answers to YES/NO questions.

#### For You To Do

1. Watch this video to get a feel for the toy you will be modeling.

2. You may wish to look at the [Wikipedia entry for Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball)®for some possible answers that the toy can give to a YES/NO question. Notice that of the twenty possible answers listed, ten are affirmative \(green\), five are non-committal \(yellow\), and five are negative \(red\).

3. Write code to model a fortune-telling toy. You are encouraged to change any aspects of the project to personalize it and fit your creative needs. For example, consider changing the predictions of the ball; use exciting images for the costumes such as a crystall ball and jingling bells, and maybe even add a sound file to provide an eerie background noise.
   1. You can import images and sound files from your desktop into your Snap_! _document by dragging and dropping them into the Costumes and Sounds tabs respectively, as shown in the video below. ![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Magic8Ball_img/ImageandSoundImport.gif)

#### Take It Furhter

1. Trick your friends to think that your automated fortune teller actually knows things and tells the truth. Create a version of your model that allows you to select among a certain type of choices when a particular key is _secretly_ pressed. For example, when the key "1" is pressed only affirmative answers are chosen, when the key "2" is pressed only non-committal answers are chosen, when the key "3" is pressed only negative answers are chosen. Have fun but please be nice!
2. Fortune telling machines have been popular in our culture for a long time. For example, in the movie "Big", starring Tom Hanks, Josh, the protagonist, as a young boy, is granted a life-changing wish by the magical automated fortune teller Zoltar. Create your own fortune telling program that goes beyond giving simple answers to YES/NO questions.
