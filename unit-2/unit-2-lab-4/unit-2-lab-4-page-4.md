**In this **_**year long **_**project,**you will develop a program that plays Tic-Tac-Toe as well as you do.

**On this first page,**you display a Tic-Tac-Toe board and let two human players enter moves.

One approach to this problem uses _multiple sprites _to make an "active" Tic-Tac-Toe board, in which each square is actually a separate sprite. Each sprite knows which square it's in, because once the board is set up, the sprites never move. You click in a square, and the sprite that you clicked on changes its costume to display the move. It doesn't have to compute the square number based on the mouse coordinates.
