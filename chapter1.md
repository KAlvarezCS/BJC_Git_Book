# Getting started with Snap!

**In this **_**lab**_**,**you'll program an app that you can share with others and play on your phone.

**On this **_**page**_**,**you'll learn how to create your own account to store your code, how to log in and out, and how to change your account password.

## Creating an Account

### For you to do:

If you haven't already opened

1. Snap, open it now: [**http://snap.berkeley.edu/run**](http://snap.berkeley.edu/run)
2. In the Snap! window, click the Cloud menu \(![](http://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/cloud_button.png "Cloud button")\), select "Signup...", and follow the instructions.

3. Then, check your email to get your initial password, and log in.
4. Now, select "Change Password..." from the Cloud menu, and change your password to something easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess.

If you're doing this in class, you should be working with a partner. If each of you is in front of a computer, one of you should keep Snap! open, and the other should keep this lab page open. If you are sharing a computer, use two browser tabs.

### Logging In to and Out of Your Snap\_!\_Account

You should be logged in whenever you are coding. Here's how to check if you are logged in

1. Click the Cloud menu in the tool-bar.

   1. **If **it says "Logout" and your user name, then you are already logged in.

   2. **If **it says someone else's user name, then log them out and log in with your own user name.
   3. **Otherwise,** choose "Login..." and enter your user name and password.

2. Do you have time to continue programming right now?

   1. **If **you do, then click NEXT \(on the top right of this page\).

   2. **Otherwise**, log out \(using the Cloud menu\).

\`\`\` Remember to log out every time you are done programming.
